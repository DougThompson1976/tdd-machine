A2 provides a relevant point, but doesn't fully explain why the vortex forms. A3, while true in some cases, has a minimal effect on small scales like a drain.\n\nRevised answer: The formation of a vortex when water goes down the drain is primarily caused by the conservation of angular momentum, which forces the water to spin as it gets closer to the drain in order to maintain its momentum. The shape of the container and external forces might influence the vortex, but have less significant effects."}]
