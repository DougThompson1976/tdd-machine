let's build a new script dev.py
we can call the function chat_with_gpt4(text) from chat.py

the script will run in an infinite loop
it constantly does this:
- builds a template string from a file called 'prompt', passing these params: execute_result, log
  - these params are stored in json files
  - log is an array of strings
- calls gpt4 with this text
- prints the response
- parses the response from gpt4:
  - I'm thinking - maybe we can assume json format too
  - `{ thinking, intention, execute, intention, summary }` - all fields are of type `string[]`
- executes the `execute` section using subprocess, and constructs a execute_result.json
  - { intention, command, stdout, exitCode }
- adds the summary to the log file
