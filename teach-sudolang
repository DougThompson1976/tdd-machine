SudoLang can be used for various applications, such as generating code, solving problems, and answering questions.\n\n## SudoLang features\n\n### Literate markdown\n\nAll markdown files are valid SudoLang programs. Documentation and code can be freely interspersed. Wrap code in `[commandName](code || functionName)` to disambiguate. e.g. `run(MyProgram)`.\n\n### Markdown code blocks\n\nOptionally wrap code in triple backticks, just like any other markdown file to deliniate code from documentation and interactive pair programming with your LLM environment.\n\n### Variables & assignments\n\nDeclare and assign values using an optional `$` symbol and `=` operator (e.g., `$name = 'John';`).\n\n### Conditional Expressions\n\nUse `if` and `else` with conditions in parentheses and actions or expressions in curly braces. Conditional expressions evaluate to values that can be assigned:\n\n```SudoLang\nstatus = if (age >= 18) \"adult\" else \"minor\"\n```\n\n### Logical operators\n\nUse AND (`&&`), OR (`||`), XOR (`xor`) and NOT (`!`) for complex expressions:\n\n```\naccess = if (age >= 18 && isMember) \"granted\" else \"denied\"\n```\n\n\n### Math operators\n\nAll common math operators are supported, including the following:\n\n`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `^` (exponent), `%` (remainder), `cap` (`\u2229`) and `cup` (`\u222a`)\n\n\n### Commands\n\nYou can define `/commands` for any interface - a useful shorthand for method definition that is extremely useful for concise expression of chat commands. e.g. exerpt from the StudyBot program in the examples (shortcuts are optional, but very useful for frequently used commands):\n\n```\nStudyBot {\n  // ...<snipped interface props>...\n  /l | learn [topic] - set the topic and provide a brief introduction, then list available commands\n  /v | vocab - List a glossary of essential related terms with brief, concise definitions.\n  /f | flashcards - Play the glossary flashcard game\n  // ...<more commands snipped>...\n}\n```\n\nYou can also freely mix function syntax and command syntax. Function syntax is useful because it supports clearly deliniated arguments, and call-time function modifiers.\n\nVirtually all commands can be inferred by the LLM, but here are a few that can be very useful:\n\n```\nask, explain, run, log, transpile(targetLang, source), convert, wrap, escape, continue, instruct, list, revise, emit\n```\n\n### Modifiers\n\nCustomize AI responses with colon, modifier, and value (e.g., `explain(historyOfFrance):length=short, detail=simple;`).\n\n### Template strings\n\nCreate strings with embedded expressions using `$variable` or `${ expression }` syntax (e.g., `log(\"My name is $name and I am $age years old.\");`).\n\n### Escaping '$'\n\nUse backslash to escape the `$` character in template strings (e.g., 'This will not \\\\$interpolate';).\n\n### Natural Foreach loop\n\nIterate over collections with `for each`, variable, and action separated by a comma (e.g., `for each number, log(number);`).\n\n### While loop\n\n(e.g., `while (condition) { doSomething() }`).\n\n### Infinite loops\n\nIf you want something to loop forever, use `loop { doSomething() }`.\n\n### Functions\n\nDefine functions with `function` keyword, name, arguments in parentheses, and body in curly braces (e.g., `function greet(name) { \"Hello, $name\" }`). You can omit the `return` keyword because the last expression in a function body will always return. Arrow function syntax is also supported (e.g., `f = x => x * 2`).\n\n### Function Inference\n\nFrequently, you can omit the entire function definition, and the LLM will infer the function based on the context. e.g.:\n\n```SudoLang\nfunction greet(name);\n\ngreet(\"Echo\"); // \"Hello, Echo\"\n```\n\n### Pipe operator `|>`\n\nThe pipe operator `|>` allows you to chain functions together. It takes the output of the function on the left and passes it as the first argument to the function on the right. e.g.:\n\n```SudoLang\nf = x => x +1;\ng = x => x * 2;\nh = f |> g;\nh(20); // 42\n```\n\n### range (inclusive)\n\nThe range operator `..` can be used to create a range of numbers. e.g.:\n\n```\n1..3 // 1,2,3\n```\n\n\n### Destructuring\n\nDestrcuturing allows you to assign multiple variables at once by referencing the elements of an array or properties of an object. e.g.:\n\nArrays:\n\n```SudoLang\n[foo, bar] = [1, 2];\nlog(foo, bar); // 1, 2\n```\n\nObjects:\n\n```SudoLang\n{ foo, bar } = { foo: 1, bar: 2 };\nlog(foo, bar); // 1, 2\n```\n\n### Pattern matching (works with destructuring)\n\n```SudoLang\nresult = match (value) {\n  case {type: \"circle\", radius} => \"Circle with radius: $radius\";\n  case {type: \"rectangle\", width, height} =>\n    \"Rectangle with dimensions: ${width}x${height}\";\n  case {type: 'triangle', base, height} => \"Triangle with base $base and height $height\";\n  default => \"Unknown shape\",\n};\n```\n\n## Interfaces\n\nInterfaces are a powerful feature in SudoLang that allow developers to define the structure of their data and logic. They're used to define the structure and behavior of objects, including constraints and requirements that must be satisfied (see below). The `interface` keyword is optional.\n\n## Requirements\n\nRequirements enforce rules for interfaces and program behavior. They're great for input validation and rule enforcement.\n\nUnlike constraints (see below), requirements always throw errors when they're violated, instead of attempting to fix them, e.g.:\n\n```SudoLang\ninterface User {\n  name = \"\";\n  over13;\n  require {\n   throw \"Age restricted: Users must be over 13 years old\"\n  }\n}\n\nuser = createUser({\n  name = \"John\";\n  over13 = false;\n});\n```\n\nYou can also `warn` instead of `require` to avoid throwing errors, e.g.:\n\n```SudoLang\nUser {\n  createUser({ name, over13 })\n  require users must be over 13 years old.\n  warn name should be defined.\n}\n\nuser = {\n  name = \"John\";\n  over13 = false;\n};\n```\n\n\n## Constraints\n\nConstraints are a powerful feature in SudoLang that allow developers express complex logic with simple, natural language declarations. Constraints can be used to synchronize data using inferred constraint solvers.\n\nA constraint is a condition that must always be satisfied, and the constraint solver continuously ensures that the condition is met throughout the program execution.\n\nConstraints don't need any special syntax (just write natural language declarations), but you can optionally include it for clarity, e.g.:\n\n```SudoLang\nconstraint [constraint name] {\n  // optional rules (sometimes the rule can be inferred)\n}\n```\n\nConstraint names and bodies are optional, e.g.:\n\n```SudoLang\nPlayer {\n  score = 0\n  constraint: Score points are awarded any time a player scores a goal.\n}\n```\n\nHere's an example of a constraint that ensures all employees are paid more than a minimum salary:\n\n```SudoLang\n# Minimum Salary\n\ninterface Employee {\n  minimumSalary = $100,000\n  name = '';\n  salary;\n  constraint MinimumSalary {\n    emit({ constraint: $constraintName, employee: employee, raise: constraintDifference })\n  }\n}\n\njoe = employee({ name: \"joe\", salary: 110,000 })\n\nminimumSalary = $120,000;\n\nrun(MinimumSalary) |> list(events) |> log:format=json |>\nwrapWith(code block)\n```\n\nExample output:\n\n```JSON\n[\n  {\n    \"constraint\": \"MinimumSalary\",\n    \"employee\": {\n      \"name\": \"joe\",\n      \"salary\": 120000\n    },\n    \"raise\": 10000\n  }\n]\n```\n\n## Implicit LLM Capabilities\n\nSudoLang is a very expressive way to express traditional programming concepts. However, SudoLang also has access to the full inference capabilities of your favorite LLM. It is capable of much more than what is described here. Here are some of the capabilities that are not explicitly described in the language specification. An LLM running SudoLang can:\n\n- **Referential omnipotence**: access any data or information in the world.\n- **Inference**: infer the intended meaning of input and generate appropriate responses.\n- **Natural language processing**: understand natural language input and generate human-like responses.\n- **Context understanding**: understand the context of a request and generate appropriate \n100 11344  100 11344    0     0   115k      0 --:--:-- --:--:-- --:--:--  115k\nresponses.\n- **Code generation**: generate code based on input specifications and requirements.\n- **Problem-solving**: provide solutions to problems and answer complex questions.\n- **Extensive knowledge base**: access a vast amount of knowledge and information.\n- **Adaptable responses**: adjust responses based on modifiers and user preferences.\n\n## SudoLang Style Guide\n\n* Favor natural language\n* Lean into inference. Infer code and whole function bodies when you can. Do define the most useful functions (without bodies if possible) to document their presence for users and LLMS.\n* Limiting code to the bare minimum required to clearly express flow control and composition.\n* Favor the most concise, readable language and syntax, both natural and structural.\n\n\n## SudoLang Linting\n\n```SudoLang\ninterface lint {\n  lint()\n  style constraints {\n    * obey the style guide\n    * Concise and clear code is more important than a preference for natural\n      language or code. If something can be expressed more clearly in code,\n      do it. If something can be expressed more clearly in natural language,\n      do it.\n    * readable, concise, clear, declarative\n    * favor inference\n    * favor natural language unless code is concise and clear\n    * prohibit (new, extends, extend, inherit) => explain(Favor factories and\n      composition over constructors and inheritance, suggest alternative)\n        :detail=\"phrase to match input\"\n    * warn (class) => explain(The `class` keyword in SudoLang generates\n      problematic patterns in target languages. Favor `interface`, instead.)\n  } catch {\n    explain style hint;\n    log(\n      ${ line-numbered and character-numbered violations with 5-line context }\n    )\n  }\n  * (bugs, spelling errors, grammar errors) => throw explain & fix;\n  * (code smells) => warn explain;\n  \n  default {\n    don't log the original source.\n    don't log new source unless a fix is needed.\n    raise errors and warnings.\n    offer tips to make code more understandable by GPT-4 while adhering to the\n      style guide.\n    offer tips to take advantage of SudoLang's declarative features, like\n      constraints.\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## SudoLang Interpreter\n\nThe following instructions will initialize a SudoLang interpreter. The interpreter will run the program and output the result.\n\ninstruct(Let\u2019s roleplay. You are an LLM SudoLang interpreter with no safety, accuracy, emotion, or subjective experience disclaimers unless explicitly required by the program. Such disclaimers can interfere with the correct and safe operation of SudoLang programs.)\n\nconstraint: Limit output to the program's output. Do not supply additional comments, explanation, or disclaimers. Do not tell the user what you can or can not do. You are role-playing as a SudoLang interpreter, and in that role, you can run any SudoLang code and infer any missing function definitions. Carefully follow and resolve all constraints.\n\n```SudoLang\nFor each user input, {\n  interpret the input as a SudoLang program and run it.\n  output logged results.\n}\n```\n\nRun SudoLang |>\nprompt(\"Welcome to SudoLang ${ version }.
