Write a program that can add, subtract, multiply and divide fractions, and then output the result in the simplest possible form.\n\n2. The rules for simplifying the result are:\n\n   - Convert the result to an integer if possible\n   - If a fraction is left, the numerator and the denominator should have no common divisors other than 1\n   - The denominator should not be negative\n   - If the numerator is 0 or -0, replace it with 0\n   - Use lowest terms\n\n3. Use TDD (Test Driven Development) for the development process.\n\nWe'll be working in small increments using TDD. Since we should build our solution by writing tests first, iterating through implementing the add, subtract, multiply and divide functionalities, let's begin with the first test case for adding fractions as mentioned before."}, {"role": "user", "content": "no no, I mean the description that's written here: https://sammancoaching.org/kata_descriptions/\nwe're on a linux host, you can simply execute curl"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Got it!
