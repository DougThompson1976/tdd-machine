thinking:
We are starting the Game of Life kata
Need to read through the kata description first
summary:
Starting the Game of Life kata
intention:
Read the gol.md file containing the kata description
thinking:
The Game of Life kata description was read successfully
summary:
Understood the Game of Life kata description
intention:
Devising a test for the first requirement: a cell with fewer than two neighbours dies
thinking:
The user has given no input, but the previous instructions mentioned devising a test.
summary:
Starting the Game of Life kata, understood its description, and now devising a test.
intention:
Create a test file for the first requirement: a cell with fewer than two neighbours dies.
thinking:
Created a test file for the first requirement of the Game of Life kata: a cell with fewer than two neighbours dies.
summary:
Test file for the first requirement of the Game of Life kata has been created.
intention:
Make the test fail by running it with unittest.
thinking:
The test has passed but it should have failed
The test case is not properly set up
summary:
Test case is not properly set up
intention:
Setup a failing test case
thinking:
The test case now fails as expected
I should now implement the functionality to make this test pass
summary:
Setup a failing test case for cell with less than two neighbours dies in the Game of Life
intention:
Implement functionality for Game of Life; cell with less than two neighbours dies
thinking:
the test case still fails
reason: no change in the test after adding function
I should now modify the test to use new function
summary:
test failed; no change in the test after adding function
intention:
modify the test to call the new function
thinking:
Test case now correctly uses the function cell_dies
Running the test case shows all tests pass
summary:
Modified the test case to correctly use the function cell_dies; all tests pass
intention:
All tests pass so now we will commit the current changes
thinking:
The last step was successful. The test for a requirement, 'a cell with fewer than two neighbours dies', passed and the code changes are committed.
Ready to proceed to the next requirement
summary:
Successfully implemented the requirement: 'a cell with fewer than two neighbours dies' of the Game of Life kata
intention:
Create a test for the next requirement: 'a cell with two or three neighbours lives on to the next generation'
thinking:
The new test has been successfully added
The new test should fail since the corresponding function has not been implemented yet
Let's run the test to confirm this
summary:
Created a new test for the requirement: 'a cell with two or three neighbours lives on to the next generation'
Now we need to run the test and expect it to fail
intention:
Run the updated test file to see if the new test fails as expected
thinking:
The test passed when it should have failed. This indicates the new test was not picked up properly by the test runner.
summary:
The new test for the requirement: 'a cell with two or three neighbours lives on to the next generation' didn't fail as expected. The test runner hasn't picked it correctly.
intention:
Correct the test definition and rerun the test
thinking:
Now that the test for 'a cell with two or three neighbours lives on to the next generation' is correctly failing
summary:
The new test for the requirement: 'a cell with two or three neighbours lives on to the next generation' now fails as expected
intention:
Implement the logic for the requirement 'a cell with two or three neighbours lives on to the next generation' inside the gol module
thinking:
The test for 'a cell with two or three neighbours lives on to the next generation' is failing as expected because the logic is not implemented yet
summary:
The test for the requirement 'a cell with two or three neighbours lives on to the next generation' fails as expected
intention:
Add a function to meet the requirement 'a cell with two or three neighbours lives on to the next generation'
thinking:
The new function 'lives_on' has been added into the 'gol.py' file
The test 'test_cell_with_two_or_three_neighbours_lives_on' is failing because it's still asserting False
I need to call the 'lives_on' function inside the failing test and rerun the tests
summary:
The new function 'lives_on' has been added. Now, the failing test needs to be modified to use the new function and tests need to be rerun
intention:
Replace 'assert False' with 'self.assertTrue(lives_on(2))' in the 'test_cell_with_two_or_three_neighbours_lives_on' test and re-run the tests
