-   have it summarize in three different lengths the situation
    -   then the log will be forgetful
    -   e.g. longest summaries live for 2 iterations
    -   mid length for 5 iterations
    -   one liners live for 20 iterations
    -   important things live forever
-   Q: how to git log -n 10, commit msg, commit contents, word diff, no author, no dates / times
-   sudo:
    -   git init if not
    -   one small thing at a time
    -   prefer very small files
    -   commit
    -   examples, with cat after writing files
    -   format the output
        -   optional sections
            -   `thought:`
            -   `intention:` - a summary of the forward intention
            -   `execute:`
            -   `summary:` - a summary of prev results
-   experiments should be done in an empty folder - git init
    hello
