This is a small experiment, with some very cool results! ðŸ˜Ž

It has very few components:

-   A [script](./chat-and-execute.py) that emulates the chat interface with ChatGPT, with the extra capability of [running arbitrary commands given by the AI on the host](#the-execute-directive) (of course the script itself was built with ChatGPT)
-   a [SudoLang](https://github.com/paralleldrive/sudolang-llm-support/blob/b477188820678cdedc7dcf0cc9b5e526be277532/sudolang.sudo.md) prompt ["CLI Coder"](./sudo/cli-coder.sudo)

When used together we effectively get a **TDD Machine**, that works in small steps, constantly verifying the previous steps using concrete commands on the host cli.

[Here's an example](./fizzbuzz-chat-readable) of the machine working on the fizzbuzz kata, almost entirely unsupervised. Thanks to the small and concrete feedback it gets from the commands it's executing on the host it's able to course correct and find its way to the solution.

## Run It

```shell
export OPENAI_API_KEY=XXX
python chat-and-execute.py
```

**Note:** gpt-4 seems to do the better job here...

## The `execute:` Directive

The AI can respond with lines of the form `execute: {command}` - and these commands are automatically executed on the host as a child process.

This of course gives the AI access to any tool (e.g. `curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nitsanavni/tdd-machine/main/README.md`, `python -m pytest`, `cat main.py`).

example:

AI says:

```markdown
execute: git status
```

Automatic response:

```
executeResult {
  cmd: git status
  output: On branch main
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/main'.

Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git restore <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
        modified:   current_chat.txt

Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
        git-status

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
  exit: 0
}
```
