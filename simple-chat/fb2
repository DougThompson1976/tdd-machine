It imports required libraries and sets API key, URL, and headers for the OpenAI API.\n2. It has utility functions to create and manage chat files, including creating a new chat file, obtaining the chat history, storing the chat history, and switching to a different chat.\n3. It has a `contact_api` function that sends the chat history and user input to the OpenAI API, receives a response, and adds it to the chat history.\n4. It has an `execute_and_get_result` function that executes shell commands and returns the output and exit status.\n5. It has a `split_response_and_command` function to extract the execution command and normal message content from the API response.\n6. It utilizes a `while` loop to continuously take user input and perform actions based on the input, either interacting with the API or switching chats when the input starts with \"switch\". If a command is part of the response, it executes the command and informs the API about its result.\n\nNotice that this script allows executing arbitrary shell commands, which can be potentially dangerous if not used carefully."}, {"role": "user", "content": "let's support multi-line user input"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "To support multi-line user input, you can modify the while loop in the following way:\n\n```python\nwhile True:\n    user_input_lines = []\n    print(\"You (Press Enter twice to submit your input):\")\n    while True:\n        line = input()\n        if line:\n            user_input_lines.append(line)\n        else:\n            break\n\n    user_input = \"\\n\".join(user_input_lines)\n\n    if user_input.lower().startswith(\"switch \"):\n        _, new_chat_filename = user_input.split(\" \", 1)\n        change_chat(new_chat_filename)\n        print(f\"Switched to chat: {new_chat_filename}\")\n    else:\n        assistant_response = contact_api(user_input)\n\n        message, command = split_response_and_command(assistant_response)\n\n        print(f\"GPT-4: {message}\")\n\n        if command:\n            command_output, exit_status = execute_and_get_result(command)\n\n            print(f\"Output: {command_output}\\nExit Status: {exit_status}\")\n\n            user_input = f\"The command executed with the following output:\\n{command_output}\\nExit Status: {exit_status}\"\n            assistant_response = contact_api(user_input)\n\n            message, command = split_response_and_command(assistant_response)\n\n            print(f\"GPT-4: {message}\")\n```\n\nThe modified while loop now collects multiple lines of input from the user.
