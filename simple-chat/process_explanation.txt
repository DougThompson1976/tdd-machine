This chat includes a modified script that allows for the execution of predefined commands by passing them as arguments with the 'exec:' keyword. It demonstrates how to use the script to run git commands such as git diff, git log, and git commit. The user simply needs to respond with an appropriate command structure when prompted, and the modified script will execute the command and return the output.
