[{"role": "user", "content": "how would you recommend adding threads of comments on blog posts on a jekyll site?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "To add threads of comments on blog posts on a Jekyll site, I recommend using a third-party commenting system like Disqus or Hyvor Talk, as Jekyll does not have built-in support for comments. Here's how you can add Disqus comments to your Jekyll site:\n\n1. Sign up for a Disqus account: Go to https://disqus.com/ and sign up for a free account. Then follow the steps to create a new site on Disqus, adding your site's information.\n\n2. Get your Disqus universal embed code: After creating your site, go to the \"Settings\" page and look for the \"Universal Embed Code.\" It should look like this:\n\n```html\n<div id=\"disqus_thread\"></div>\n<script>\n    var disqus_config = function () {\n        this.page.url = PAGE_URL;\n        this.page.identifier = PAGE_IDENTIFIER;\n    };\n    (function() {\n        var d = document, s = d.createElement('script');\n        s.src = 'https://EXAMPLE.disqus.com/embed.js';\n        s.setAttribute('data-timestamp', +new Date());\n        (d.head || d.body).appendChild(s);\n    })();\n</script>\n<noscript>Please enable JavaScript to view the <a href=\"https://disqus.com/?ref_noscript\" rel=\"nofollow\">comments powered by Disqus.</a></noscript>\n```\n\n3. Add the embed code to your Jekyll site: Open your Jekyll site's source code and locate the file for your blog post layout, typically `_layouts/post.html`. Insert the universal embed code just before the closing `</article>` tag (or any other appropriate location within the post content).\n\n4. Update the Disqus configuration in the embed code: Replace `PAGE_URL` and `PAGE_IDENTIFIER` with the appropriate Jekyll variables to provide unique URLs and identifiers for each post:\n\n```javascript\nthis.page.url = '{{ site.url }}{{ page.url }}';\nthis.page.identifier = '{{ page.id }}';\n```\n\nAfter these changes, your Disqus embed code should look like this:\n\n```html\n<div id=\"disqus_thread\"></div>\n<script>\n    var disqus_config = function () {\n        this.page.url = '{{ site.url }}{{ page.url }}';\n        this.page.identifier = '{{ page.id }}';\n    };\n    (function() {\n        var d = document, s = d.createElement('script');\n        s.src = 'https://EXAMPLE.disqus.com/embed.js';\n        s.setAttribute('data-timestamp', +new Date());\n        (d.head || d.body).appendChild(s);\n    })();\n</script>\n<noscript>Please enable JavaScript to view the <a href=\"https://disqus.com/?ref_noscript\" rel=\"nofollow\">comments powered by Disqus.</a></noscript>\n```\n\n5. Save and build your Jekyll site: Save the changes you've made to the post layout, and if applicable, rebuild your Jekyll site. Your blog posts should now have Disqus comment threads enabled.\n\nIf you want to use Hyvor Talk or other commenting systems, the process is similar to the one above. Just follow their installation instructions, and you will have threaded comments on your Jekyll site."}]
