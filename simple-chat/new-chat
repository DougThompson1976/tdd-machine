Here's a brief explanation of how your script works:\n\n1. You've imported the required modules and set API_KEY and API_URL for making API requests.\n2. A series of functions are defined for creating and handling chat history files, changing the active chat, and interacting with the GPT-4 API.\n3. In the `main` section of your script, you take the user input from the command line and check if it starts with \"switch \" to change the active chat.\n4. If the user input is not to switch chat, it sends the input to the GPT-4 API via the `contact_api()` function.\n5. If the API response starts with \"execute:\", the script extracts and runs the command, capturing its output and exit status.\n6. The command output and exit status are then sent back to the GPT-4 API for further conversation, and the final response is printed.\n\nYour script successfully allows you to interact with the GPT-4 API, switch between chats, and execute commands provided by the AI.

Added a function `split_response_and_command()` to split the assistant response and the command part.\n2. Wrapped the main part of the script in a `while True` loop to allow continuous interaction.\n3. Used `input()` to read user input instead of reading from `sys.argv`.\n4. Upon receiving assistant responses, we now split them into a message and a command using the `split_response_and_command()` function.\n5. If a command is present, it will be executed, and the output will be sent back to the GPT-4 API as before.\n\nYou can now interact with the GPT-4 API, execute commands, and chat concurrently using this modified script.

If you want to use the command line arguments with your script, you can modify the script to read the arguments and then run the code in a loop as before.

You can pass the output of a command, such as a file's content, as the initial input, and it will be processed correctly. If you want to enter more input or commands, you can use the `input()` prompt; to quit the script, just type \"exit\".\n\nThis modified script allows you to use both the command line arguments and interactive input for a more flexible user experience.
